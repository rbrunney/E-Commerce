## Description
---

<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This basic E-Commerce project was made in order to learn Microservices. Some of the technologies used in the project include Spring Boot, .NET (SDK 6), Docker, Docker-Compose, Eureka, Mongo, MSSQL, and basic HTML and Javascript for a throw together front end. This project has helped understand the basics of Service Oriented Architecture.

### How to Start
</u>

1. Once downloads have been complete lets start of straightaway into building our docker containers.
2. Go into the cloned repositories folder.
3. Once in the folder navigate into this path

    ```
    ./E-Commerce/E-Commerce/E-Commerce Docker files
    ```

4. Once in the correct folder location open up your preferred ternimal within that folder path.
5. With your desired terminal opened run the following command to build all of the necessary containers to run the program.

    ```
    docker compose up -d
    ```
6. A good output will look something similar as shown below.
