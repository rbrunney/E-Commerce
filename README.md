## Description

</div>
<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This basic E-Commerce project was made in order to learn Microservices. Some of the technologies used in the project include Spring Boot, .NET (SDK 6), Docker, Docker-Compose, Eureka, Mongo, MSSQL, and basic HTML and Javascript for a throw together front end. This project has helped understand the basics of Service Oriented Architecture.
